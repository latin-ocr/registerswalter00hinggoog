body-Chapel of the Cathedml, before its Alter. A lleed oi
the Chapter, says Oliver, dated 25 Jan, 1299, expressly states
that this was the oasa—“cujus corpus ante Altare Beate
Maria humatum quiescit.'' The marble alab which covered his

grave was removed some two Centuries ago, and laid across
the Great West Doorway of the Nave ; and the Crosa and the

Inscription incisod upon it had been “ by coustant friction of ¹

feet, nearly obliterated, when the late Mr. John Jonas, of
Franklyn,1nduced the Chapter, in Nov, 1820, ιο restore it to

its original place, and the Oross and Letters were re·cut under r

his superintendsnoe.” Itis a conspicuous object, now—oon-
s iouous for its simplieity—in the midst of the very beautiful
oor oi marble and tiles with which the Lady Chapel was
paved in the course oi the recent Restoration,-a poor· monn·
ment, indeed, in comparison with the stately llemorials oi other
Bisho which surround it. It bears no name but the Christ-
ian amc, no date; only around the margin this quaintly
expressed prayer for the great Bishop’s reposo-“aura tegit
flatrum: tristil afficiet cibi istrum.'' Perhaps it was felt that
the, even then, glorious Church was, itsell, his best and fittest
Memorial; ior the “Si Monumentum requiris, circumspice,'’
which marks the testing-place oi another famous Architect,
may fairly be applied to the distinguished Prelate to whose
genius and zeal we owe, not only the priceless inheritanec oi
is own actual work, but the inspiratiou whioh guided his
Successore, one aiter the other, till Grandisson, loyal to Quivit
to the last, completed our Cathedral, as we see it today-
inferior in height and in siae to others, no doubt, bnt second
to none in respect oi the surpassing beauty oi its details aud
its singular unit of design and purpose. We owe to Bishop
Quirites Amh escon Freeman has shewn, the internal trans-

says that it “appears cartalu.” But no authority ior these dates is given hp either.
Among the Excheqner Records, however, are various accounts toucbing the empor-
alities oi the different Sees, during ramucies and on otheroccasions3 bnt only two hare
been preserved, relating to this Dioneae, oi earlier date than 80 Henr. VIII. ‘Phe flrst

important; for it proves that Quivil died, neither ou the nh nor on the dth, but on
