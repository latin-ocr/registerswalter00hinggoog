our Bishop was a man of extraordinary energy and activity,
full oi good works, and ever intent on romating both the
spiritual and tho worldly intarests of his ilockff Oliver tells
us that, in 1270, he obtained from the Orown a Market and
Fair ior Bishopsteignton end that, on the 8th oi May in that
year, hc rocurcd the confirmation ci the Royal Charters
which beon grantodtotbe See during the ttwo hundred
and scvcnt six years (See Ap ndix Ι1 ). William of
Woreester, he adds, styled our Bis op “Walter lc Goode‚'' and
he meritcd the title by the excellence of his character and his
many munificent deeds. The Registrar oi Newenham extols
his numerous acts of bounty to that Abbey-his donation of
six hundred marks towards the building oi the Conventual
Ohurch, and his gire of six Altcrs thereto‚ vin, St. Gabriel's‚
St. Thomas,' end St. Katherine's on the north side, and St.
J ohn's‚ St. Annos, and St. Nicholes‚' on the south. The Grey
Friers of Bodmin venerated him as their special Benefactor.
At (hyse ho rebuilt the Manor-Honse‚ which became the
favourite residence of his Successore its gateway bearing the
{ititiitttissrtitttihdiriditis} brici
the Collegiate Ohurch of Crediton to its antient s lendour,
and—moved thereto by a Dream, as the Epicapi on his
Tomb tells us—ho founded another College (which he dedi-
cated to St. Thomas-the-Martyr) at Glesney, near Penryn.
His Biographer repudiatos, as well he mi ht, “the senseless
calumny broached by Hcker, Godwin‚ and Izacke, to depre-
ciate hrs memory‚’' in the matter of his acquisition of an
Estote called Brombmhe, to ether with the Advowson of the
Church of OlystFomison3 ior it stands victoriously refuted
in the Conveyanoe·Deed, fortunately preserved in his Register
(aee p. 50), which shews that he purchased the property cf
Richard Fomiscn, the Lord oi the Manor, the consideration
redceilverlpI being twenty pounds of silver and an Estote called
‘⁸ e a ore.”

Though the Bisbop’s activities‚ es we have scen, were un-
cos-sing, there is reason to believe thet, physically, hc was not
arobust man As early as 1264 we find him excusing his
non-attendente et the Parliament held, that year,at St. Alban's,

11t does not appear that he ever deputed to Suffragans any portion of his work,
aeaut once, sor c few months, in 1275 (see p. 202). 'ibere are no ordination hints in
his chister ; but the detes of his ordinatione· not, 1 think of all-are recorded ; and
