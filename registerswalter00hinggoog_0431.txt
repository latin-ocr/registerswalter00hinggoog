ADDITIONAL NO'I'ES.

ADDITIONAL NOTES, ETO„ TO BISHOP QUIVIL'S
REGISTER.

I think it expedient to print r'sa' aetenae the rtions oi this
Register which have been rendered practica ly illegible hp

thc use oi galls. It is no exaggeration to say that bot
the es of folio 128 look more like what is commonly called
a ‘⁴ ᾗ Man's Plaster '' than an thin else, and other portione
of the MS. are scarcely less disllgurel. Some of the Entries
are quite obliterated, and most oi them have only been
deoiphered with the greatest difficulty, in astrong light,
and with the help ol a poweriul glass. Even so, Ι had to
retum to many oi them, over and over againbefore I could
read thern. It is not probable that any other person will,
hereafter, attempt such a taek3 and, as the condition of these
foliosis not likely to improve‚ it would be a ity not to make
the most oi t'ne almost blinding labour whichl have expended

able to decipher wlrile my Book was in preparation, l have, oi
course, included in the “Index ''; and while the sheete were
passing through the Press Ι have lost no opportunity oi work-
ing in any that Ι was able to rccover in time. The others—
and they are not very numerous-I must be content to set
forth here, together with such further explanatory Notas as
may appear to be necessary or useiul :-
