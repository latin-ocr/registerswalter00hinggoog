These were, indeed, eventiul years ior our cathedrsl and Diocese. But
more remeius to be told. lior Walter de Lecchelede, who hed heen ccllated
to the Precentorrhip on the lst oi August, 1282, was brutslly murdered, in
the Gethedrnl-Ysrd, in 1283, end Pycot was eccused oi being, et least, privy
to the crium! The Register is entirely silentes to this tregedy, though
the Precentor's death is mentioned more then once ; a circumstance which led
Dr. Oliver end others to doubt, ior a time, the truth oi the story as nerreted
by liolrer. lt mey be lsirly assumed that, however guiltless Pycot may
have been, there must have been some plausible reason ior suspecting him ;
end, as it is clear thet Leechclude wes the lesden oi one oi the contending
parties in the Chapter, it is very probuble that he was the most prominent
und uctive opponent oi Pycut's cluime. ln the Letter oi Pontissanc, Bislrop oi
Winchester, which l have printed above (see pege ³43), reference ie ntede to e
lierce ‹lispute which was raging at the time over the Stull oi the Archdeecon oi
Exeter, the eppcintmcut to which, ior that turn, lay with the Roman Curia ;
end itis distinctly stated that Lecchelade wss vehemently opposing the men
oi their choice, and had iorcibly possessed himseli oi the Stall, the House,
end the revenuee atteehed 1ο the Dignity. Unheppily the Mandate oi the
cardinal Archbishop oi Tusculum, quoted by Pontiesara, was reduced to a
mere “Venerabili Petri, em,” in the Register; so we do not know the
claimant's neme¹; but the Letter wes written on the 31st oi llnrch, 1288,
and the Obituary oi the cathedral iixes the Precentor's death on the eth
oi November following, und no doubt correctly, ior his successore in the
Precentorship end in the Ganonry were collated on the leth. Ide notlilrs
to suggest thet Pyoot· himsell (whose Election es Desn wss still being
centssted) coveted the post, and thet this was the excuse ior charging
him with the murder, hut there must heve been seme reeson² ior so
grave an accusation, sven ii we come to the conclusion that he was

make good use oi so scd en occurrence, in order to cust him finally inem
the Deamhip. At any rute, hewse tried, and, with others who were sup-
posed to be his accompliees, condemned, end cest into prison. And, event
ually, he resigned, or wes deprived, ior Andrew de Killrenny was elected Dean
on the 13111 oi March, itti-5. 'l'he immediate result was pesce in the long
egitsted Cethedral Body, and the record oi Killsenny's,Election in the Register,
is couched in unusual and significant terms,-“ unanimiter, necnon concorditer,
ab omnibus Conccnons'ctt aab, nemine manante, set per emnium impie-arionem
el eodem die Oanfimaacio fuit ipsius Eleati, et eciam Centimalum suit penam

, long disgraced the Chapterl
