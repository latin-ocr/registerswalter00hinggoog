South (louet, end visiting, in rapid succession, a large number oi places, eome oi
which ere not altogether eaey of eoooes even now, end must bave been much less
eo over euch roeds aa the good Bishop and his retinue hed to enoounter more than
eix hundred yesrs ago. He visited St. Anthony-in-lloseland on the 3rd; St.
Michael-Carbayee end 'l'regeare (hir Manor in St Gonane) on the oth; Meva-
giesey, and Bedrigan (iu St Geren) on the eth: St. Austell on the 9th; eud hooc,
many miles over the hille, eeetwurd, on the llth. That night he reached St
German'a Priory, end spent the next day there ; preceding to Shevioke on the
leth, Antony on the lltlr, the remote Per-iah oi Reme on the loth, Pillaton (miles
away, to the North, and by a very eimuitoue route) on the loth, b’t. liellion ou
the lith, Botuefleming on the 18th, St Dominiek on the ioth, North Potherwin
(iar away, in North Oornwell, beyond Leunoeeton), on the tend, St. Oletber on
the rard, Keliy (across the Tamer) on the alth, end St. stephane-by-teunoeewn
on thoreth! It will be well worth enyone'e while to follow the indefatiguble
Biehop’e route on the hiep. Ite recitat might well be regarded ee almost in·
eredible, but ior the ieet thet his Regieter recorda the work done et every place,
und therebyincreaeeeour wonder. For iu the couree oi some thirty days he
dedieewd no lower thau twenty-one Churohee, in addition to attending to much

Dioceern work oi other kinds. Weery end worn, we may well believe, he retired
to bis quiet Home at Ohudleigh ior a weelr'e rest, having mossed the great Moor.
And even here work aweited him, ior on November oth he <tedoad the Per-ish

Chureh3 and on the eth he eet out again, viaiting sixteen widely scettered
Parishee within a mouth, end dediceting no leve than thirteen Ohurohee 1

It is evident theta great wave oi zeel for the Houees of
God had ewept over the whole Dioeese, ior we find that,
between September, 1259, and the end of 1268, the Biehop
wae called upon to dedicate eighty-eight re-built or enlarged
Ohurchee. Oi these Dedications iorty occurred in e single
year. Many of the old Sanetuariee, ereeted in Saron or in
Norman daya had, probably, become deoeyed, or, perhaps,
even ruinous, and demanded the Reetorer's hand. And it is
interesting to be able to traee in many instancee, even now,
the work that was done then. The beautiful little Ohureh oi
St. Anthonyin-Roeeland, cruciform, with a centrel tower,
alone comes down to ue quite unehanged since the day on
which Breuesoombe dedicated it; end it tells ite own tole
clearly. Its builders spered the grand old south doorway oi
the Norman Ohureb, end all besides is their own work. I
have visited most of the Churehes on the liet (eae pp. 65-68);
and, though nearly the whole oi them have been all but

The Bishop spent the greater part of the yeer 1260 in
London, oceaaionally visiting his Mauors in surrey, flente, and
Sussex. But August and September were devoted tobis
Dioeese; and in the course oi 1261 he again visited every pert
